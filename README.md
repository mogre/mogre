# mogre
Official website for Mogr√© Ceramiche

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ npm start

# build for production and launch server

```

## Notes
- index.html files are inside language folder, so launching the dev server will not point to the correct page right away (go to llocalhost:8080/it)
- Images are tracked on GitHub via Git LFS
